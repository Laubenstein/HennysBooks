# HennysBooks
A Book management Software written in Java.

This is my first real attempt at creating a piece of software with Java.
It lets you create a private Booklist and manage it.
Planned features:
- add a separate wishlist for books (changeable status to "in posession" or delete)
- sort list by book attributes
- add "publishing date" to book attributes
- merge books to a series
- switch from awt to swing
- read from existing excel file
